        <h2>Cabin in the woods</h2>
        <p>
            <!-- &nbsp adds a space -->
            You quietly walk up to the cabin until you're standing just outside the door.<br>
            The only sounds you hear are the crickets chirping.  Other than that, everything seems quiet.<br>
            The immediate area around the cabin gives the impression that someone is currently living here.<br>
            Around the side of the cabin, light is still flickering in the only window.<br><br>
            Do you want to knock on the door?<br>
            Or do you want to try looking in the window?

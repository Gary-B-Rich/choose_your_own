            The door isn't locked and opens easily.  You hesitantly walk inside.<br>
            The flickering light is coming from a burning oil lamp.  Other than the<br>
            lamp, there doesn't appear to be any signs of anyone around.  But why would<br>
            someone light a lamp, and then leave?  Strange.

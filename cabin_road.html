        <h2>Nope out</h2>
        <p>
            <!-- &nbsp adds a space -->
            Nobody seems to be home, so you turn around and start heading back to the main road.<br>
            About 50 yards from the cabin you step in a bear trap that you didn't see in the dim moonlight.<br>
            You try to free yourself, but the trap is firmly lodged in your broken leg.<br>
            <br>
            Nobody finds you in time.

            It is an early summer evening, just past nightfall.<br>
            Stars fill the sky, as a small crescent moon offers little light.<br>
            You are driving through a remote area with only the radio to keep you company.<br>
            An unexpected flat tire and no spare leaves you stranded in the middle of nowhere.<br>
            You try your cell phone, but there's no service.<br>
            By your estimation the next gas station is about 10 miles up the road.<br><br>
            Will you wait in the car, and hope someone comes along?<br>
            Or will you start walking?

            You decide to wait in the car and hope someone comes along.<br>
            90 minutes pass, and not a single car approaches.<br>
            You check your phone again, and there's still no service.<br>
            Half of the battery life has already been drained since you broke down.<br>
            (Searching for a signal always causes it to die quickly.)<br>
            Deciding to save the battery, you power your phone off.<br>
            After another 30 minutes pass, you relunctantly decide to start walking.<br><br>

            You lock the car and start walking down the road in the dark.  Both sides are lined with dense forest.<br>
            After what feels like about an hour, you come across a dirt path leading into the woods.<br>
            You can't see where the path leads, but you notice a distant light flickering in that direction.<br><br>
            Do you want to stay on the main road?<br>
            Or do you want to see if the path leads to someone who can help?

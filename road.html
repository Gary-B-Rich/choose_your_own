        <h2>Road to ruin</h2>
        <p>
            <!-- &nbsp adds a space -->
            You decide to 'nope out', and continue on the main road.<br>
            After a while you check your phone again for reception, but the alert still shows 'no service'.<br>
            You're surprised that you haven't stumbled upon any houses yet.  And you're also surprised that<br>
            you still haven't seen a single vehicle since breaking down several hours ago.<br>
            "This is crazy", you say outloud.  "Not one car or house this whole time!  Unreal."

            <!-- &nbsp adds a space -->
            You no more than say that, and you notice that theres a house in the distance.<br>
            It was hard to see, because there isn't a single light on anywhere.<br>
            Either everyone is asleep, or nobody is home.<br>
            <br>
            Immediately after you realize the house is there, headlights appear up the road heading toward you.<br>
            After a minute or two, an old beat up pick up truck pulls up and rolls to a stop.<br>
            The driver offers you a ride to the gas station, but he seems extremely intoxicated.<br>
            <br>
            Do you take him up on his offer?<br>
            Or do you want to see if anyone is home at the house?
